# fractalgenerator

This repo is for ARM64 code that generates images of popular fractals like the burning ship fractal. The Ship folder is for code that generates the 'burning ship' fractal. The Assembly code generates the fractal and the C code takes care of saving the image and interfacing wiht the Assembly program.
