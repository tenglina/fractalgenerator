# Assembly Programming

ARM64 code that generates images of popular fractals like the burning ship fractal. The Ship folder is for code that generates the 'burning ship' fractal. The Assembly code generates the fractal, and the C code saves the image and interfaces with the Assembly program. An example of what the image looks like is also provided in the folder.
